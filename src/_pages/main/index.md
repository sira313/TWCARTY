#### Hello World
I used Eleventy to create this website because I find it the easiest Static Site Generator (SSG) to understand, especially with its support for using `*.html` for layout. I chose DaisyUI as the CSS framework because its simple tutorials matched my level as a beginner. 

#### Eleventy
Eleventy is a popular Static Site Generator (SSG) tool used by web developers to build websites. It allows developers to create websites from various template languages, including HTML, Markdown, and others. Eleventy is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a favorite among developers who prefer a straightforward approach to building static websites.

I apologize for any shortcomings as I am not a coder by background. The source code of this starter is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sira313/twcarty). Thanks for coming.
